# Hoby's Game Engine Practice

Hello there, this HGEP repository is my project to practice C++ and CMake. I've heard a lot of things about OpenGL as well, so I decided to 
learn a bit more about it.

I'm running on Ubuntu 22.04, so I chose not to use Visual Studio, and anyway, I'm writing code on NeoVim (more practice).

There's an ensemble of techs that I'll have to learn on the way:
- C++
- CMake
- OpenGL
- ODE ([Open Dynamics Engine](https://www.ode.org/))
- g++

There will be more to come and the Game Engine is not destined to be a full project. Merely for practice. Hopefully, I hope by sharing what I do
with this, is you'll learn a thing or two. Even I will probably learn from you, dear reader!
